This site allows for the revitalizing of otherwise unusable/archived maps such as historic maps, site surveys, site plans, etc. turning them into usable geographic data which is subsequently made available as a KML file for use in Google Earth/Maps and as a Web Mapping Service (WMS) for using in web-based webmapping application such as NEPAnode or in desktop GIS software.",public,DOE General Counsel,John Jediny,John.Jediny@hq.doe.gov,019:60
